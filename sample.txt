Summary:
In a quiet village by the sea, a young girl named Lila discovered an old, abandoned lighthouse. 
Every evening, she would climb to the top and watch the waves crash against the rocks. 
One night, she noticed a faint light flickering from the horizon. 
Curious, she rowed out and found a tiny boat carrying a mysterious, glowing map.
The map led her on a secret journey across the ocean, through hidden coves and sparkling islands, 
revealing treasures of knowledge and courage. 
Along the way, Lila realized the true treasure wasn’t gold, but the friendships she formed and the bravery she found within herself. 
By the time she returned home, the villagers noticed that the once-abandoned lighthouse now shone brightly, guiding others as it once guided her.
